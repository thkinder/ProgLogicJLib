=============

Java library that can be used to create schematic like structure with Java object to generate automatic HDL code for FPGAs and CPLDs. 

This code is licensed under 3 clause BSD license, so it can be used for commercial as well as other purposes. 

The folder src/ contains the library source code that you can use and modify. 

The folder lib/ contains the source files as a JAR file that you can link to your project. The library has been created with Eclipse Kepler for Java SE 1.6

The folder doc/ will soon contain documentation and how to's
